## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Topics
#### List Class 2
- Override the method toString() to print the list.
- Sort a list using clase `Collections`.
- Sort a list using clase `Comparator` method `comparing` to select type of attribute to use to sort.
- Use of `strem()` to filter a list.
- Filter a list using `filter()` methodf of `stream()`.

#### List Class 3
- Create a list inside a list of object and get the values of that sublist using `get()` method.
- Get an inmutable list using `unmodifiableList()` method of `Collections` class.
- see how does work the different methods of `List` interface.
- add elements to a list using `add()` method.
- See principal differences between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` classes.
    - LinkedList is better to add and remove elements from the list.
    - ArrayList is better to get elements from the list.
- Use `get()` method to get an element from a list.

#### List Class 4
- Sort value of a list using `Collections`.
- Filter value of a list using `for`.
- Sum value of a list using `for`.
- Use `filter()` method of `stream()` to search or exclude elements from a list.
- Use `mapToInt()` method of `stream()` to get specific values from a list.
- Learn how to use `avarage()`, `max()` and `min()` methods of `stream()` to get different kind of results.
- Make a group by of a list using `groupingBy()` method of `Collectors` class.

#### set class 5
- Use `HashSet` adding values to a `Set` using `add()` method.
- Read a `HashSet` and print the values.
- Underderstand hierarchical tree of `Collection` class.
- Use `Collections` interface to generalize a list of `HashSet` so then according to the needs migrate a `Set` to a `List`.
- Use `max()` method of Stream to get the max value of a list.
- Use `removeIf()` method of our Collection interface.
- Explain the difference between `Set` and `List` interfaces.
    - `Set` is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.

#### Other types of sets and iterator class 7
- Reading values of a list using `Iterator` interface through `next()` method.
- Know what exception can throw when we use `next()` method.
- Know that `Iterator` interface is a `fail-fast` iterator and is an old way to reading values of a list.
- Know that the first differecen between `Set` and `List` is that `Set` does not allow duplicate elements.
- Recognize that `Set` and `List` are part of `Collection` interface and for that we can use methods that it's contains.

#### maps class 8
- Know that a `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs that allows us to access to it's values faster.
- Search values of a `Map` through a key is faster than search values of a `List` or `Set`.
- Using maps is useful when we have unique references in our data as DNA, ID, etc. Because that wayt we can differentiate the values and put them as a unique key in our register.
- Reading values of a `Map`.
