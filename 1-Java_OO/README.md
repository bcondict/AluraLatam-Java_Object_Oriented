# Java Orientado a Objetos

This is part of my learning process of Java with Alura Latam as part of Oracle Next Education. This is a repository of my notes and exercises.
You can fin my certificate [here](https://app.aluracursos.com/degree/certificate/7f862058-8fe0-444f-a6e2-71f1992e0f2a).

My notes are in Spanish, but I will try to translate them to English.

There are fake exercises to replicate real cases.

I encourage you to go take a look and see my knowledge, all feedback is welcome.
